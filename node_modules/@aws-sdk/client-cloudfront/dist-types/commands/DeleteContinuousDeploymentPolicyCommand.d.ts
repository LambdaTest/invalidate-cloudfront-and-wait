 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudFrontClient, DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudFrontClient, DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudFrontClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudFrontClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudFrontClient's `config` shape.
