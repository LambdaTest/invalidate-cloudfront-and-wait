/**
 * <p>Updates a continuous deployment policy. You can update a continuous deployment policy to
 * 			enable or disable it, to change the percentage of traffic that it sends to the staging
 * 			distribution, or to change the staging distribution that it sends traffic to.</p>
 * 		       <p>When you update a continuous deployment policy configuration, all the fields are
 * 			updated with the values that are provided in the request. You cannot update some fields
 * 			independent of others. To update a continuous deployment policy configuration:</p>
 * 		       <ol>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>Use <code>GetContinuousDeploymentPolicyConfig</code> to get the current
 * 					configuration.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>Locally modify the fields in the continuous deployment policy configuration
 * 					that you want to update.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>Use <code>UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicy</code>, providing the entire
 * 					continuous deployment policy configuration, including the fields that you
 * 					modified and those that you didnâ€™t.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *          </ol>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudFrontClient, UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudFrontClient, UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudFrontClient(config);
 * const command = new UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudFrontClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudFrontClient's `config` shape.
